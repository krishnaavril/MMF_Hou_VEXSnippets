# Houdini VEX Snippets
## Initial Provisions
This repository is designated to be a place where I put some of the VEX snippets I've been using to fix, check, create and manipulate information in different contexts. If something is needed to be revisited, let me know to check for it and commit any of the required requested modifications.

In short, knowledge is useless if it isn't shared.
