# Houdini VEX Snippets
## Initial Provisions
This repository is designated to be a place where I put some of the VEX snippets I've been using to fix, check, create, and manipulate information in different contexts. If something needs to be revisited, let me know so I can check for it and commit any of the requested modifications.

""" Create tangent based on neighbours in a line. """;

// Get neighbours of current point and capture it's position.
int neigh[] = neighbours(0, @ptnum);
vector pos = point(0, "P", neigh[-1]);

// Get direction vector by subtracting the current position to
// the neighbour one and normalize the vector to get the proper
// length to work with.
vector tan = normalize(v@P-pos);

// Check if the current point is equal to the maximum points
// minus one (ptnum starts from 0) and negate tangent to obtain
// the opposite direction.

// Set attribute.
